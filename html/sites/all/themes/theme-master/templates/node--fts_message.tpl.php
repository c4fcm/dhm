/**
 * @file
 * Bartik's theme implementation to display a node.
 *
 * Available variables:
 * - $title: the (sanitized) title of the node.
 * - $content: An array of node items. Use render($content) to print them all,
 *   or print a subset such as render($content['field_example']). Use
 *   hide($content['field_example']) to temporarily suppress the printing of a
 *   given element.
 * - $user_picture: The node author's picture from user-picture.tpl.php.
 * - $date: Formatted creation date. Preprocess functions can reformat it by
 *   calling format_date() with the desired parameters on the $created variable.
 * - $name: Themed username of node author output from theme_username().
 * - $node_url: Direct url of the current node.
 * - $display_submitted: Whether submission information should be displayed.
 * - $submitted: Submission information created from $name and $date during
 *   template_preprocess_node().
 * - $classes: String of classes that can be used to style contextually through
 *   CSS. It can be manipulated through the variable $classes_array from
 *   preprocess functions. The default values can be one or more of the
 *   following:
 *   - node: The current template type, i.e., "theming hook".
 *   - node-[type]: The current node type. For example, if the node is a
 *     "Blog entry" it would result in "node-blog". Note that the machine
 *     name will often be in a short form of the human readable label.
 *   - node-teaser: Nodes in teaser form.
 *   - node-preview: Nodes in preview mode.
 *   The following are controlled through the node publishing options.
 *   - node-promoted: Nodes promoted to the front page.
 *   - node-sticky: Nodes ordered above other non-sticky nodes in teaser
 *     listings.
 *   - node-unpublished: Unpublished nodes visible only to administrators.
 * - $title_prefix (array): An array containing additional output populated by
 *   modules, intended to be displayed in front of the main title tag that
 *   appears in the template.
 * - $title_suffix (array): An array containing additional output populated by
 *   modules, intended to be displayed after the main title tag that appears in
 *   the template.
 *
 * Other variables:
 * - $node: Full node object. Contains data that may not be safe.
 * - $type: Node type, i.e. story, page, blog, etc.
 * - $comment_count: Number of comments attached to the node.
 * - $uid: User ID of the node author.
 * - $created: Time the node was published formatted in Unix timestamp.
 * - $classes_array: Array of html class attribute values. It is flattened
 *   into a string within the variable $classes.
 * - $zebra: Outputs either "even" or "odd". Useful for zebra striping in
 *   teaser listings.
 * - $id: Position of the node. Increments each time it's output.
 *
 * Node status variables:
 * - $view_mode: View mode, e.g. 'full', 'teaser'...
 * - $teaser: Flag for the teaser state (shortcut for $view_mode == 'teaser').
 * - $page: Flag for the full page state.
 * - $promote: Flag for front page promotion state.
 * - $sticky: Flags for sticky post setting.
 * - $status: Flag for published status.
 * - $comment: State of comment settings for the node.
 * - $readmore: Flags true if the teaser content of the node cannot hold the
 *   main body content.
 * - $is_front: Flags true when presented in the front page.
 * - $logged_in: Flags true when the current user is a logged-in member.
 * - $is_admin: Flags true when the current user is an administrator.
 *
 * Field variables: for each field instance attached to the node a corresponding
 * variable is defined, e.g. $node->body becomes $body. When needing to access
 * a field's raw values, developers/themers are strongly encouraged to use these
 * variables. Otherwise they will have to explicitly specify the desired field
 * language, e.g. $node->body['en'], thus overriding any language negotiation
 * rule that was previously applied.

      <em>Dear Information Focal Point,<br /><br />

      Please distribute the following message to all of your cluster partners on behalf of the Financial Tracking Service in Geneva.<br />
      Thank You.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
      Dear <?php print $cluster_contact; ?>,<br /><br />

      As you may know, FTS is a global, on-line, real-time database of humanitarian funding needs and international contributions.  Its purpose is to improve resource allocation decisions and advocacy, by clearly indicating to what extent populations in crisis receive humanitarian aid, and in what proportion to needs. FTS depends on both donors and appealing organisations to provide the raw data that is reflected online (fts.unocha.org). This data is used for analytical and advocacy purposes throughout the year.<br /><br />  

      Please ensure that the information registered on FTS is correct by <?php print $date; ?>.  The financial tables for <?php print $emergency; ?> are available at: <?php print $url; ?> or you can use the attached file to filter the information for your organisation.<br /><br />

      For UN agencies, FTS has focal points in most UN agency headquarters, but it is still helpful if you check online to verify that the information is correct. All communication with FTS should be channelled through your HQ if possible.<br /><br />

      For NGOs, information can be shared in one of two ways:

      <ol>
      <li>You can use the on-line contribution form located at http://fts.unocha.org (click the "report a contribution" link on the left).</li>
      <li>You can send an email to fts@un.org</li>
      </ol>

      Either way, we ask you to specify at least the following for each individual contribution: 
      
      <ol>
      <li>Donor country or organisation</li>
      <li>Date of contribution (or decision)</li>
      <li>Amount (in original currency if available) or if in-kind, the amount, description, and value of goods</li>
      <li>One-line description of the contribution</li>
      <li>Appeal project code (if relevant)</li>
      </ol>

      If any financing for humanitarian projects came from your organisation's own private fundraising efforts, or from unearmarked funds from bilateral donors, please let us know. <br /><br />

      You do not need to report funding from the country-based pooled fund (CHF or ERF), or funding that you might have received as an implementing partner of another organisation (either a UN agency or another NGO). <br /><br />

      Please don't hesitate to contact [insert local OCHA focal point] or fts@un.org if you have any questions. <br /><br />
